# Azure Core Tracing OpenTelemetry client library for Python

## Getting started

### Install the package

Install the Azure Core OpenTelemetry Tracing plugin for Python with [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/):

```bash
pip install azure-core-tracing-opentelemetry
```

Now you can use OpenTelemetry for Python as usual with any SDKs that are compatible
with azure-core tracing. This includes (not exhaustive list), azure-storage-blob, azure-keyvault-secrets, azure-eventhub, etc.

## Key concepts

* You don't need to pass any context, SDK will get it for you
* There are two ways to enable the tracing plugin in code:

  ```python
  from azure.core.settings import settings
  from azure.core.tracing.ext.opentelemetry_span import OpenTelemetrySpan
  settings.tracing_implementation = OpenTelemetrySpan
  ```

  or

  ```python
  from azure.core.settings import settings
  settings.tracing_implementation = "opentelemetry"
  ```

* Alternatively, if you have the latest version of `azure-core` installed, you can also set the following environment variable to enable tracing with OpenTelemetry:

  ```bash
  AZURE_SDK_TRACING_IMPLEMENTATION=opentelemetry
  ```

## Examples

There is no explicit context to pass, you just create your usual opentelemetry tracer and
call any SDK code that is compatible with azure-core tracing. This is an example
using Azure Monitor exporter, but you can use any exporter (Zipkin, etc.).

```python

# Declare OpenTelemetry as enabled tracing plugin for Azure SDKs
from azure.core.settings import settings

settings.tracing_implementation = "opentelemetry"

# In the below example, we use a simple console exporter, uncomment these lines to use
# the OpenTelemetry exporter for Azure Monitor.
# Example of a trace exporter for Azure Monitor, but you can use anything OpenTelemetry supports
# from azure.monitor.opentelemetry.exporter import AzureMonitorTraceExporter
# exporter = AzureMonitorTraceExporter(
#     connection_string="the connection string used for your Application Insights resource"
# )

# Regular open telemetry usage from here, see https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-python
# for details
from opentelemetry import trace
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace import TracerProvider
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace.export import ConsoleSpanExporter
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace.export import SimpleSpanProcessor

# Simple console exporter
exporter = ConsoleSpanExporter()

trace.set_tracer_provider(TracerProvider())
tracer = trace.get_tracer(__name__)
trace.get_tracer_provider().add_span_processor(
    SimpleSpanProcessor(exporter)
)

# Example with Storage SDKs

from azure.storage.blob import BlobServiceClient

with tracer.start_as_current_span(name="MyApplication"):
    client = BlobServiceClient.from_connection_string('connectionstring')
    client.create_container('my_container')  # Call will be traced
```

The Azure Monitor OpenTelemetry Exporter can be found in the [`azure-monitor-opentelemetry-exporter`](https://pypi.org/project/azure-monitor-opentelemetry-exporter/) package.


## HTTP instrumentation

With the Azure Core OpenTelemetry Tracing plugin enabled, HTTP requests made by Azure SDK clients are typically instrumented via the [`DistributedTracingPolicy`](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/sdk/core/azure-core/azure/core/pipeline/policies/_distributed_tracing.py) automatically. Since Azure Core handles HTTP instrumentation for Azure service calls, automatic HTTP instrumentation from other libraries such as `opentelemetry-requests-instrumentation` are suppressed to avoid duplicate spans from being created.


## Troubleshooting

This client raises exceptions defined in [Azure Core](https://learn.microsoft.com/python/api/azure-core/azure.core.exceptions?view=azure-python).


## Next steps

More documentation on OpenTelemetry configuration can be found on the [OpenTelemetry website](https://opentelemetry.io)

# Release History

## 1.0.0b11 (2023-09-07)

### Bugs Fixed

- Fixed `OpenTelemetrySpan` typing to correctly implement the `AbstractSpan` protocol. ([#31943](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/pull/31943))

## 1.0.0b10 (2023-07-11)

### Features Added

- Enabled the use of the `context` keyword argument for passing in context headers of a parent span. This will be the parent context used when creating the span. ([#30411](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/pull/30411))

### Breaking Changes

- Remapped certain attributes to converge with OpenTelemetry semantic conventions ([#29203](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/pull/29203)):
    - `x-ms-client-request-id` -> `az.client_request_id`,
    - `x-ms-request-id` -> `az.service_request_id`,
    - `http.user_agent` -> `user_agent.original`,
    - `message_bus.destination` -> `messaging.destination.name`,
    - `peer.address` -> `net.peer.name`,

### Other Changes

- Python 2.7 is no longer supported. Please use Python version 3.7 or later.
- Nested internal spans are now suppressed with just the outermost internal span being recorded. Nested client spans will be children of the outermost span. ([#29616](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/pull/29616))
- When client spans are created, a flag is set to indicate that automatic HTTP instrumentation should be suppressed. Since azure-core already instruments HTTP calls, this prevents duplicate spans from being produced. ([#29616](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/pull/29616))
- Schema URL is now set on the tracer's instrumentation scope. ([#30014](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/pull/30014))
- Minimum `opentelemetry-api` dependency bumped to `1.12.0`.
- Minimum `azure-core` dependency bumped to `1.24.0`.
